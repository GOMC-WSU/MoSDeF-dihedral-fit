abstract="Scientific research involves the formulation of theory to explain observed phenomena and using experimentation to test and evolve these theories. Over the past two decades, computational modeling and simulation (M{\&}S) has become accepted as the third leg of scientific research because it provides additional insights that often are impractical or impossible to acquire using theoretical and experimental analysis alone. The purpose of this chapter is to explore how M{\&}S is used in system-level healthcare research and to present some practical guidelines for its use. Two modeling approaches commonly used in healthcare research, system dynamics models and agent-based models, are presented and their applications in healthcare research are described. The three simulation paradigms, Monte Carlo simulation, continuous simulation, and discrete event simulation, are defined and the conditions for their use are stated. An epidemiology case study is presented to illustrate the use of M{\&}S in the research process.",

abstract="Simulation is nowadays considered to be the third pillar of science, a peer alongside theory and experimentation [105, p. 12], [55, p. 1], [88], [19, p. 1]. The analysis of many systems, processes and phenomena is often only feasible by developing simulation models and executing them using vast amounts of computing power. Forecasts, decision support and training are further areas that are regularly supported or even made possible by using simulation.",

Atomistic modelling approaches are cost-effective and time-consuming alternatives to expensive and time-consuming experimental methods, and they are precise enough to predict the mechanical characteristics of materials. The current chapter goes through the many steps involved in a molecular dynamic's investigation. The various types of interatomic potentials and their applicability to various materials have been thoroughly examined. Following that, the integration algorithm for solving a set of Newton's equations, as well as the radius cut-off distance and temperature control, was addressed. Afterwards, many types of ensembles and boundary conditions were addressed, which helped in simulating real-world experimental settings. The approaches for minimizing energy have also been briefly explored. Finally, the limitations of molecular dynamics have been examined, as well as their applicability.",
